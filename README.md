## Synchronization
The Dynamix DNS Client is our official open source synchronization tool for Windows. Dynamix DNS Client scans for IP address changes, runs external configurable applications when your IP address changes, and also uses our API to update your records minimizing any potential downtime an IP address change might cause.  When an IP address change is detected, selected dynamic DNS hosts are updated to point to your latest IP address.  Run this application on your Windows server.
